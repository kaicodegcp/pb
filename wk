Enabling EAP Bitbucket to GitHub Migration Through Team Demo

Description

This week, the EAP Engineering team supported the Bitbucket-to-GitHub migration initiative by conducting a live demo for engineering teams. The session demonstrated the migration workflow, highlighted the importance of lint-free repositories, and walked through the required commands to help teams prepare their code for GitHub.

The effort focused on simplifying the migration process and ensuring teams clearly understand the steps needed to complete their repository transitions efficiently.
