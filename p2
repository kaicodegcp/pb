Description

This week, focused efforts were made to create and publish step-by-step internal documentation for the installation and validation of Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) and Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) services on OpenShift-based dev clusters. These Confluence pages were designed to standardize onboarding and validation procedures for engineering and operations teams.

Key Accomplishments
