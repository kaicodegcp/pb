Hi Vishwa,

Thank you for sharing the Databricks GitHub repositories and Terraform registry references.

I will be supporting the infrastructure setup for the Databricks platform and will primarily focus on developing and implementing the Terraform code required for the deployment. I will be working closely with Sinchana to ensure the infrastructure is provisioned in alignment with the architectural standards and best practices.

Vishwa, I understand you will be leading the architecture aspects, and I look forward to collaborating with you to translate the design into a scalable and secure infrastructure.

Please let us know if there are any immediate next steps, design prerequisites, or onboarding requirements for the repositories so we can begin the implementation.

Thanks,
Satish
